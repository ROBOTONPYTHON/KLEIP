**Simple Summary**

Introduce a registration fee to the Keng Lernitas Ekosistem to mitigate the risk of Sybil attacks and validate new participants.

**Abstract**

This proposal aims to introduce a KL registration fee of 0.01 ETH for new participants who wish to verify themselves and become a part of the Keng Lernitas Ekosistem. This fee will act as a deterrent against Sybil attacks by ensuring that all participants have a stake in the ecosystem.

**Motivation**

To improve the security and integrity of the Keng Lernitas Ekosistem, it is crucial to implement measures that reduce the risk of Sybil attacks. By introducing a registration fee, we can ensure that all participants are legitimate and have a vested interest in the ecosystem.

**Specification**

- A fee of 0.01 ETH will be required for new participants to register and verify themselves in the Keng Lernitas Ekosistem.
- This fee will be collected at the time of registration and will be non-refundable.
- The registration process will only be completed once the participant has successfully paid the registration fee.
- The collected fees will be used to support the development and maintenance of the Keng Lernitas Ekosistem.

**Parameters**

- **Registration Fee:** 0.01 ETH

**Rationale**

The introduction of a registration fee is a common practice in many decentralized ecosystems to mitigate the risk of Sybil attacks. By requiring participants to have a financial stake in the ecosystem, we can ensure that they are less likely to engage in malicious activities. This fee is set at a level that is affordable for most participants but significant enough to deter the creation of fake accounts.

**Test Cases**

- Verify that new participants are required to pay the registration fee of 0.01 ETH.
- Ensure that the registration process is only completed once the fee is paid.
- Confirm that the collected fees are correctly allocated to the designated development and maintenance fund.
